      Classy Studio’s designer lets you build your campaign’s layout, design the
      look and feel of your pages, and add text, buttons, images, and custom
      code to create a donation page fit for your needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Classy Studio, you can add or delete sections, drag and drop elements,
      and place widgets such as a donation form or FAQ where you need them.
    </p>
    <h2 id="add-remove-or-move-blocks">Add, remove, or move blocks</h2>
    <p>
      You can add sections and elements to your canvas by dragging and dropping
      them from the editor to your canvas. To move or remove blocks, you’ll need
      to hover over the element or section and select the appropriate icon.
    </p>
    <h3 id="add-blocks">Add blocks</h3>
    <p>
      Add layouts, elements, and widgets to your canvas by dragging and dropping
      the block from the editor to the canvas.
    </p>

    </p>
    <h3 id="remove-blocks">Remove blocks</h3>
    <p>
      Remove sections, elements, or widgets by selecting the block you want to
      remove and then selecting the trash can icon.
    </p>

    <div class="callout--tip">
      <p>
        <strong>Tip: </strong> Confirm you’re removing the right element or
        section by viewing the tab that appears when hovering over the block.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3 id="move-blocks">Move blocks</h3>
    <p>
      Move a section, element, or widget to another part of the canvas by
      hovering over the block, selecting the drag icon (six dots at the top),
      and dragging it to its new location.
    </p>

    </p>
    <h2 id="layouts">Layouts</h2>
    <p>
      Layouts are either blank or pre-built sections you can drag and drop onto
      the canvas. Once on the canvas, you can add elements or widgets to the
      sections. All layouts span across the full width of the page.
    </p>
    <p>

        alt="Adding and editing layouts"
      />
    </p>
    <h3 id="blank-layouts">Blank layouts</h3>
    <p>
      Blank layouts consist of 1-section or 2-section layouts. These layouts do
      not include any elements or widgets.
    </p>
    <h4 id="1-section">1-section</h4>
    <p>
      Use a 1-section layout to stack elements or widgets on top of each other.
    </p>
    <h4 id="2-section">2-section</h4>
    <p>Use a 2-section layout to set elements and widgets side-by-side.</p>
    <h3 id="prebuilt-layouts">Prebuilt layouts</h3>
    <p>
      Prebuilt layouts include a Hero overlay, a Donation layout, and a Footer.
      These layouts have some elements and widgets by default. Once added, you
      can adjust these layouts to fit your needs.
    </p>
    <h4 id="hero-overlay">Hero overlay</h4>
    <p>
      The hero overlay is a 2-section layout with separate background images and
      a left-aligned title and paragraph element.
    </p>
    <h4 id="donation-layout">Donation layout</h4>
    <p>
      The donation layout is a 2-section layout with a donation form, share
      button, and FAQ widget. It also includes a header and paragraph element.
    </p>
    <h4 id="footer">Footer</h4>
    <p>
      The footer layout can only be added to the bottom of the page. It includes
      information about your organization, including the name, address, contact
      information, and social links.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use the editor to style the background color and opacity of the section.
      Also, select the <strong>Configure</strong> tab to edit the logo and
      social links that appear.
    </p>
    <h2 id="elements">Elements</h2>
    <p>
      Elements are the page's content, including text, buttons, and images. You
      can add elements to sections of your page by dragging and dropping them
      onto the canvas.
    </p>
    <p>The full list of elements includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Title</li>
      <li>Heading</li>
      <li>Paragraph</li>
      <li>Button</li>
      <li>Image</li>
      <li>Custom code</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="title">Title</h3>
    <p>
      Title elements are a large header that can improve search result rankings
      and accessibility. We recommend using only a single Title element near the
      top of your page.
    </p>
    <h3 id="heading">Heading</h3>
    <p>
      Heading elements are another header that appears smaller than the title
      element. Use these to introduce additional paragraph content.
    </p>
    <h3 id="paragraph">Paragraph</h3>
    <p>
      Paragraph elements consist of the main text on your page. We recommend
      placing paragraph elements below a title or heading element.
    </p>
    <h3 id="button">Button</h3>
    <p>
      Button elements can link supporters to another campaign or an external
      page. Once added, you can adjust the button’s label, alignment, color, and
      border.
    </p>
    <h3 id="image">Image</h3>
    <p>
      Image elements are placeholders you can use to upload images to show on
      your campaign’s page. Note that these are separate from background images
      for sections.
    </p>
    <p>Images can be JPG, PNG, or GIFs and must be smaller than 2 MB.</p>
    <p>
      Once added, you can adjust the image’s overlay (a color added on top of an
      image) and its border.
    </p>
    <h3 id="custom-code">Custom code</h3>
    <p>
      Custom code elements let you add HTML and CSS to your campaign’s pages
      (Javascript is not supported). When added to your page's canvas, these
      full-width elements create a new section.
    </p>
    <h2 id="widgets">Widgets</h2>
    <p>
      Widgets are advanced elements with specific use cases and features
      built-in. You can add widgets just like other blocks by dragging and
      dropping them onto the canvas.
    </p>
    <p>The full list of widgets includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Donation form</li>
      <li>Share button</li>
      <li>FAQ</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="donation-form">Donation form</h3>
    <p>
      Supporters can use the donation form to contribute to your campaign. Once
      added to the canvas, you can customize the heading, the tax-deductible
      message at the bottom, the donation frequencies, and donation amounts.
    </p>
    <div class="callout--tip">
      <p>
        <strong>Tip: </strong>For a recurring donation campaign, turn off
        One-time donations and let supporters choose their preferred donation
        frequency.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3 id="share-button">Share button</h3>
    <p>
      The share button lets supporters share your campaign via social media,
      email, or text. When someone selects your Share widget, a pop-up appears
      to share your campaign via the methods you allow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once added to the canvas, you can customize the heading and sub-heading
      that appears in the pop-up, the options that appear, and the style of the
      button.
    </p>
    <p>
      To edit the default messages used for sharing, visit your campaign’s
      <a href="settings.html">settings</a>.
    </p>
    <h3 id="faq">FAQ</h3>
    <p>
      The FAQ widget lets you add frequently asked questions to your campaign’s
      pages to reassure supporters. Once added to the canvas, you can customize
      the widget’s questions and answers.
    </p>
