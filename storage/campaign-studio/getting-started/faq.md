# Frequently asked questions

## Will all the Classy Campaign types be available in Studio?

Yes. While starting with donation and thank you pages only, we are working to build the Studio Experience for all campaign types, including crowdfunding, peer-to-peer, and events.

## Will Classy Studio replace the current campaign builder and pages?

Yes, Classy Studio will eventually be Classy’s sole campaign-building experience. The sunset of our current campaign builder will not occur until we are confident that we have parity with our current builder and campaign types. So, in the near future, you can continue creating and launching campaigns in our legacy experience.

## Is Campaign Templating available for Classy Studio?

Not yet, but it will be. We are developing templating for Classy Studio specifically, which will be available later.

## When should I use Classy Studio versus Embedded Donation Forms versus our current campaign builder?

## I can’t see my Layout’s background image or color; why not?

One of the sections on top of the layout is likely blocking the layout. Select the section(s) on top of the layout and adjust the opacity to see if the section is blocking your layout.

## Why are saving and publishing two separate actions?

The published version of the campaign is the one that your supporters can access. Separating saving from publishing means you can make changes to your campaign and save those changes without them taking effect on the supporter-facing pages immediately.

## Will there be additional blocks, or is what I see now all I can expect?

We plan on creating many more types of elements, widgets, and layouts. You can expect to see more options as we continue development.

## Will my campaigns sync to Salesforce?

Yes, Classy Studio campaigns will sync to Salesforce. Learn more about [Classy for Salesforce](https://support.classy.org/s/article/how-to-set-up-classy-for-salesforce).

## Can I use Omatic's Raiser's Edge (RE) connector to sync Classy Studio campaigns to RE?

Yes, Classy Studio campaigns will sync to RE through [Omatic's connector](https://omaticsoftware.com/integration-solutions-by-activity/importomatic-for-raisers-edge/).
