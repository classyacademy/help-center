!!! warning "Important"

    When adding an American Express card, insert it into the reader rather than tapping to complete the process.

## Order a card reader

To purchase a reader:

1. Go to your Classy Live organization dashboard and select **Billing**
2. Under Card Reader Orders, select **Place Order**
3. Add the **Reader M2** to your cart
4. Enter shipping information and choose a shipping method
5. Enter your card info and process order

You'll receive updates about your order directly from Stripe.

## Set up the card reader

Once you receive the Reader M2, you’ll want to set it up with your event and test it to ensure everything works properly.

To start, charge it fully using the provided cable.

Each charge should provide more than 20 hours of active use.

Turn on the device by pressing the button on the left-hand side. The lights that appear indicate it's charge level and four lights means it is fully charged.

## Connect the card reader to your event

Before your event, be sure to connect your reader. The first time you connect, you may need to update the device. Updates are required and can take up to 15 minutes to complete.

[Learn how to connect the reader to your event](/help-center/classy-live/mobile-app)

## Troubleshooting

If the Reader M2 isn't connecting to your mobile device, you should:

**Check the mobile device's settings**

- Ensure both Bluetooth and Location settings are turned on
- Ensure the Classy Live app has permission to use your device’s Bluetooth and Location

[Visit Apple's documentation for Location settings](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102515)

[Visit Google's documentation for Location settings](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3467281?hl=en)

**Check the card reader's battery**

- Ensure it is turned on and charged. You can check this by pressing the button on the left-hand side.
