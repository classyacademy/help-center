# Classy Live Mobile App

Classy Live’s mobile app lets admins efficiently manage their event’s check-in process.

Today, the mobile app supports attendee check-in through tapping, swiping, or using a QR code scanner for in-person events.

In the future, the app will let event coordinators collect information, process payments, and more.
