# Classy Live Mobile App

Classy Live’s mobile app lets admins easily manage their event’s check-in process.

Right now, the app only supports manual check-in, but our team is working to expand its use.

## Login

After selecting an event, you’ll land on a page listing your event’s attendees. You can search for a specific attendee or filter your attendees based on check-in status and ticket type.

To check in an attendee, select **Check in** next to their name. Then, you’ll see a success notification with information about the attendee, such as their seating assignment, bidder number, and ticket type.
