!!! tip

    If you have more than 100 unpaid transactions, select the **Unpaid** filter and update the table to show 100 items. This way, collected balances will be removed from your view, and the next set of transactions will be available to collect.

This will take you to a bulk invoice for the selected transaction. Select **Pay** to begin processing the transactions.

As payments are successful, it will show as **Paid** and list the Transaction ID.

This will take you to a bulk invoice for the attendee’s transactions. Select **Pay** to begin processing the transactions.

As payments are successful, it will show as **Paid** and list the Transaction ID.

### Processing transactions

Transactions are processed one by one, meaning the attendee will have separate charges for each item in their cart.

Also, when you process transactions via the invoice, you can view whether transactions have been processed successfully or failed.

If a transaction fails, a reason for the decline will appear, and you can choose to retry all failed transactions. To retry just one failed transaction, return to the **Transactions** tab.

## Send bulk invoices to attendees

You can send attendees a bulk invoice, including all their transactions. This will help attendees keep track of their receipts after the event and may help to encourage them to close any open balances.

To send a bulk invoice:

1. In the Classy Live event menu, select **Alerts**
2. Select **Send** and **Send Call to Action**
3. Customize your message content
4. Select the **Action** dropdown and select **Link to Invoice**

![Send alert modal](https://learn.classy.org/rs/673-DCU-558/images/cl-alert-send-invoice.png?version=0)

Then, you can send this alert to all attendees or just attendees with unpaid or fully paid balances. Finally, you can send the alert or plan to send it automatically later.

Once you are ready, select **Save and Preview** and **Send**.

This alert includes a link to their invoice where they can view their paid and unpaid transactions. If the attendee has any unpaid transactions, they can complete payment via their invoice.

## Attendee experience

Attendees can also pay for multiple items in their cart at once. For an attendee to complete payment:

1. Go to the Classy Live event
2. In the header, select **Cart**
3. Select **Pay All**

![Attendee view pay all button](https://learn.classy.org/rs/673-DCU-558/images/cl-attendee-pay-all.png?version=0)

This will take the attendee to their invoice, where they can complete payment.

!!! tip "Event tips"

    We recommend:

    * Adding attendee's cards on file during check-in
    * Sending a CTA link to Invoice via Alerts to all attendees at the end of the event

    This will help to ensure attendees can quickly complete payment on their own and will have a record of their transactions after the event.
