# Import Attendees

When you need to register several attendees, you can import them all at once into your Classy Live event.

Once added, they’ll appear on your event’s attendee list and can participate in the event’s auction or visit the event page. These attendees will also sync back to Classy as offline transactions.

    Import Attendees is in a **closed beta** and not currently accepting new participants. Stay tuned for more information about the open beta release coming soon.

## Prepare import template

First, prepare a CSV or Excel file with their information to add multiple attendees to your event. An Import Template is available on the event’s **Attendees** page to assist you.

To download the import template:

1. In the Classy Live menu, select **Attendees**
2. Select the **Options** dropdown
3. Select **Import Attendees**
4. Select **Generate Import Template**

The template will include standard columns for attendee information and additional columns for custom questions you have turned on in the connected Classy campaign.

Standard columns include:

- **Group Name** (Only available if Group Registration is active on the account). **Note: **You can group attendees into a single transaction by adding a unique group name to this field. If left blank, each attendee will be a separate transaction.
- **Ticket Type** - **Note:** This ticket type must match the name of an existing ticket in the campaign and be set to one attendee per ticket. Ticket types that include two or more attendees cannot be imported.
- **First Name**
- **Last Name**
- **Email Address - **Must be a valid email format (example@email.com)
- **Notes**

!!! question "Missing custom questions?"

    Go to **Questions** and **Attendees** in the campaign's details to make sure the questions are active on the Classy campaign.

## Frequently asked questions

**Do I need to use the import template?**

You can also paste the attendee details or upload another file containing their information. However, we recommend the import template, as it will help reduce errors.

When using another file and verifying data, be sure to select the header row and carefully map the columns.

**Are imported attendees opted-in to receive text message updates?**

No, imported attendees are not opted-in to receive text messages.

To opt in these attendees:

1. In the Classy Live event, go to **Attendees**
2. Select **Manage Columns**
3. Add **Opt-in to receive text message updates**
4. Select **Update View**
