# Group Registrations on Classy Live

Group Registration lets purchasers manage the details for every person in their order. Purchasers can update attendees' names, email, phone number, and any custom question used in the campaign.

With Group Registration, purchasers can also send tickets to their group's attendees.

## Manage groups

When someone purchases multiple tickets or registrations to your event, they'll appear as a group under the **Groups** tab. To let a purchaser manage their group registration, an event admin needs to toggle on the **Manage** option and send the purchaser a **Manage link**.

### Manage a group

To turn on group registration for a single group purchase:

1. In your Classy Live event menu, select **Attendees**
2. Select the **Groups** tab
3. Select the group's **transaction ID**

Once you toggle on **Manage**, you can copy or send the manage link to the group's purchaser.

When you select **Send Link**, you can customize the message the purchaser receives before you send the email. Or, you can select **Copy Link** and share it with the group's purchaser however you prefer.

With the **Manage** link, the purchaser can update the attendee details for each person in their group order. Also, they can invite someone else to help them complete the details.

!!! note

      Group managers cannot edit the email addresses of attendees with event activity. Activity includes checked-in status, payment method on file, and any bids, purchases, or donations.

You can also turn on group registration for multiple groups and send the manage link to all of them.

To turn on group registration for multiple groups:

1. Select the checkbox next to the groups you want to manage
   - To select all, select the checkbox at the top of the column
2. Select **Enable Management**
3. Select **Send Link**

## Frequently asked questions

**Can I customize the message sent with tickets?**

Yes, this will send the event's **Welcome Message** with a QR code attached for check-in. You can customize your event's Welcome Message by visiting **Email Templates** in the event editor.

**If the Welcome Message is turned off, will attendees be unable to send tickets?**

No, group purchasers who manage their tickets can always send tickets to their attendees. However, this will still send the Welcome Message email template.

**Will attendees automatically receive their tickets or any notification when assigned?**

No, attendees do not receive any notification when they are assigned tickets. Admins or group purchasers will need to send a notification to assigned attendees.

**Can I update the group purchaser's first name, last name, and email address?**

The group purchaser's first name, last name, and email address cannot be edited. This helps ensure data integrity, as these are part of the purchase's billing information.

However, you can still [edit the attendee's information](https://support.classy.org/s/article/attendee-management-on-classy-live#attendee-details). If the group purchaser's email is incorrect, you can invite them to help manage their group by sharing the **Manage** link with the purchaser.
