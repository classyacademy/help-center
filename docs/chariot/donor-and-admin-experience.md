# Donor & Administrator Experience

Classy has joined forces with Chariot to evaluate the adoption and effectiveness of integrating DAF donations as a giving option on Classy forms. As our partner leads this initiative, there will be specific instances where the processing experience for DAF gifts will diverge from Classy's core payment processing and reporting functions.

As Classy evaluates adding DAFs as a payment option, we'll address these experiences, resulting in a uniform end-user experience.

Here is a high-level walkthrough of the Donor/Admin Experience with a [Completed DAF Donation (Demo)](https://www.loom.com/share/7abd69bb3c654d26912a25f22f95f6d5?sid=b03ee380-f5d2-4da5-bb58-6e66a128036e).

!!! example "A/B Testing DAF Widget"

    We intend to conduct an A/B test of the DAF widget on Classy's giving forms. The DAF option will be displayed 50% of the time, and when it's not shown, the page will function and appear as it usually does.

    We know certain pilot customers plan to target DAF donors specifically. If that's the case, please confirm your intent with your Classy contact, and we will remove this A/B test.

## Step 1. Donor Initiates DAF Donation

The donor visits the Classy giving form with DAFs turned on and selects the DAF donation option.

## Step 2. Donor Completes Grant Request

A pop-up appears, allowing the donor to complete their DAF grant request in just three clicks. The grant request has been submitted to their DAF brokerage at this time.

## Step 3. Confirmation Page

Following the successful grant request, we'll direct the donor to a confirmation page indicating the completion of the transaction.

## Step 4. Email Acknowledgement and Receipting

Classy does not automatically send an acknowledgment email and tax receipt for DAF donations. Tax receipting is not required for this transaction as the DAF gift is not tax-deductible for the donor. Instead, the respective DAF brokerage (e.g., Fidelity, Schwab) sends acknowledgment correspondence when the DAF grant is processed.

## Step 5. Data Transmission to Classy Manager

The data collected during the donation process, including donor information, designations, etc., is pushed to Classy Manager via an API integration built by Chariot.

## DAF Gifts Recorded as Offline Donations

When someone donates via a DAF, the transaction is processed outside Classy. As a result, Classy Reporting records it as an 'Offline Transaction'.

## Dedicating Gifts In Honor/Memory & Corporate Matching

During the pilot phase, DAF gifts will not support in-honor/memory dedications or corporate matching. All other payment types on the form will function normally and not impact other post-donation processes.

## Payment Processing Times for DAF Providers

DAF transaction will show up in Clasy manager in 'near-real' time.

Different DAF providers have varying payment processing times for DAF gifts, and these timelines will be important to understand for efficient fund receipt.
