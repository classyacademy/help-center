# Intro to the Supporter Center

The Supporter Center is Classy’s new hub for supporters, where they can manage their contact information, recurring donations, and receipts. Also, admins can customize this experience by adding a hero image, a thank you message, and adjusting your organization’s preferences.

It is now in GA and available to all customers. To learn more about how to customize and use the Supporter Center, view these articles:
