### What is a beta program at Classy?

Beta programs are designed to test new or modified products, or features or functionalities of existing products, which are designated as beta, lighthouse, pilot, limited release, early access, developer preview, non-production, evaluation, or by a similar description (“Beta Products”). In Classy’s beta programs, one or more of these Beta Products are being made available to select customers prior to general availability release. While Classy extensively tests such Beta Products before release, the functionality of the features of such Beta Products may not be complete, and Beta Products could experience unknown bugs that may not be immediately addressed. Classy may discontinue Beta Products at any time in its sole discretion and may never make them generally available, and Beta Products remain in beta unless otherwise specified by Classy. Please refer to Classy’s Platform Attachment for full terms and conditions governing Beta Products.
