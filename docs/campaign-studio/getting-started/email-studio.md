# Emails

Email Studio is the one-stop solution for writing, managing, and delivering emails for your fundraising campaign. This versatile tool elevates the communication experience, enhancing your interaction with donors and supporters while ensuring your messages reflect your brand.

To access Email Studio, select the **Emails** tab in Classy Studio.

## Navigate emails

From the **Emails** tab, you’ll find a list of default campaign emails. Each email has the status (on/off), the type, and the click rate for that message.

Default campaign emails include:

- Campaign admin invite
- Chargeback
- Comment on campaign activity
- One-time donation receipt
- Recurring donation failed
- Recurring donation receipt
- Recurring plan created

Select an email’s title to open the builder and edit the message. Select the toggle to turn on/off specific messages and select a message’s Click Rate to view additional metrics.

## Edit and preview emails

Select an email’s title to go to the drag-and-drop builder for that message. Within the builder, you’ll find similar tools available in Page's designer:

- Drag-and-drop sections, headings, paragraphs, buttons, and images
- Ability to customize the logo and style of your header
- Ability to add, remove, and position custom widgets

The Email builder differs from the designer in a couple of important ways:

- A single, 1-section blank layout for the initial launch
- A selection of limited, email-safe fonts
- Email-specific widgets such as **Contact Us** and **Manage Donation**

### Add dynamic content (Smart Variables)

During Early Access, we’ll provide a list of variables you can copy and paste into each email to dynamically populate data, such as recipient name, transaction amount, etc.

Later, we’ll update these settings to allow you to select these values from within the email and PDF receipt builders.
