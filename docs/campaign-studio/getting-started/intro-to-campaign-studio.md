!!! note

    Classy Studio is only available for donation pages. We’re currently working on making it available for all campaign types.

#### Choose a starting point

To help you get started, choose a starting layout for your campaign.

- **Donation form above the fold** - Best for high-converting pages. A donation form appears without the need to scroll down the page.
- **Hero image** - Ideal balance between text and imagery. Pair an appeal with an engaging image to draw in supporters.
- **Full hero image** - A captivating full-screen image tells a story through impactful visuals and layered text

#### Enter the campaign details

Then, enter some basic information about your campaign, such as:

- Campaign name\*
- Internal event name
- Campaign short URL
- Fundraising Goal\*
- Default designation

*Required</p>

#### Apply your brand

Finally, apply your brand. The options include:

- Adding a Header logo and link
- Setting the default font for headings, paragraphs, and buttons
- Setting the primary and secondary colors

Once you create your donation page, you’ll land in Classy Studio, where you can build and customize the rest of your campaign.

## Navigate Classy Studio

Classy Studio’s designer consists of the navigation menu, the canvas, and the editor.

### Navigation menu

The navigation menu appears at the top of the page. It includes:

- Settings
- Pages
- Emails
- Preview
- Save and Publish

Select **Settings**, **Pages**, and **Emails** to navigate through Classy Studio and customize each part of your campaign.

When ready, you can preview the pages, save your work, and publish your campaign before sharing it with your community.

!!! note

    Classy Studio allows you to view and edit your campaign pages in three different views, Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile. To switch between these views, select the **desktop icon** in the  navigation menu.

### Pages

Pages provide the canvas and editor to preview, build, and design your campaign. To switch to a different page, select the **Pages** tab and choose the page you want to edit.

#### Canvas

The canvas previews the supporter-facing page. You can select blocks, drag and drop them to move them around, and edit the content directly on the page.
