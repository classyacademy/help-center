## About

About settings include campaign name, Short URLs, campaign contact, and more.

### Campaign name

This is the public-facing name of your campaign.

### Internal event name

Internal campaign names are secondary names that only appear in your account. Use these to help stay organized while keeping your public campaign names on brand.

For example, if you want to test two campaign versions, the public names could be the same, and you could use internal names to tell them apart.

### Short URLs

!!! warning "Important"
Set up[ domain masking](https://support.classy.org/s/article/how-to-set-up-domain-masking) before you create and share any Short URLs. If you set up domain masking later, it will break any short URLs you have already created.

A short URL is a shorter version of your campaign’s web address. Short URLs are easier to share and can be visually appealing. Learn more about [Short URLs](https://support.classy.org/s/article/edit-your-campaign-details#short-url).

### Redirect URLs

Redirect URLs will send supporters to a page of your choice when a campaign is unpublished. Otherwise, they’ll be sent to a Classy**-**branded 404 page.

The redirect URL will automatically be filled in with the redirect set in your account settings, but you can update this for a specific campaign.

### Campaign contact

This contact information appears in your campaign's footer and emails. By default, we use your organization's email, but you can update the email and phone number for a specific campaign.

## Checkout

Checkout settings include campaign preferences such as allowing anonymous donations and customizing donor-covered fees.
