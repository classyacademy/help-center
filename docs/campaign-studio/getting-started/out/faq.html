        <h1 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently asked questions</h1>
<h2 id="will-all-the-classy-campaign-types-be-available-in-studio">Will all the Classy Campaign types be available in Studio?</h2>
<p>Yes. While starting with donation and thank you pages only, we are working to build the Studio Experience for all campaign types, including crowdfunding, peer-to-peer, and events.</p>
<h2 id="will-campaign-studio-replace-the-current-campaign-builder-and-pages">Will Campaign Studio replace the current campaign builder and pages?</h2>
<p>Yes, Campaign Studio will eventually be Classy’s sole campaign-building experience. The sunset of our current campaign builder will not occur until we are confident that we have parity with our current builder and campaign types. So, in the near future, you can continue creating and launching campaigns in our legacy experience.</p>
<h2 id="is-campaign-templating-available-for-campaign-studio">Is Campaign Templating available for Campaign Studio?</h2>
<p>Not yet, but it will be. We are developing templating for Campaign Studio specifically, which will be available later.</p>
<h2 id="when-should-i-use-campaign-studio-versus-embedded-donation-forms-versus-our-current-campaign-builder">When should I use Campaign Studio versus Embedded Donation Forms versus our current campaign builder?</h2>

<h2 id="i-cant-see-my-layouts-background-image-or-color-why-not">I can’t see my Layout’s background image or color; why not?</h2>
<p>One of the sections on top of the layout is likely blocking the layout. Select the section(s) on top of the layout and adjust the opacity to see if the section is blocking your layout.</p>
<h2 id="why-are-saving-and-publishing-two-separate-actions">Why are saving and publishing two separate actions?</h2>
<p>The published version of the campaign is the one that your supporters can access. Separating saving from publishing means you can make changes to your campaign and save those changes without them taking effect on the supporter-facing pages immediately.</p>
<h2 id="will-there-be-additional-blocks-or-is-what-i-see-now-all-i-can-expect">Will there be additional blocks, or is what I see now all I can expect?</h2>
<p>We plan on creating many more types of elements, widgets, and layouts. You can expect to see more options as we continue development.</p>
<h2 id="will-my-campaigns-sync-to-salesforce">Will my campaigns sync to Salesforce?</h2>
<p>We have some remaining work to ensure that Studio Campaigns sync to Salesforce. This will be available soon.</p>
<h2 id="coming-soon-features">Coming Soon Features</h2>
<p>List of features that are currently unavailable for Early Access but will be coming soon. We will be continually adding features throughout early access, so make sure to check beck here regularly.</p>
