# Embedded Studio

!!! example "Before you start"

    Embedded donation forms are only available for [Classy Pay](http://support.classy.org/s/article/how-to-set-up-classy-pay-powered-by-stripe) customers.

Embedded donation forms differ from donate pages because you can install them directly on your organization’s website. This helps to remove friction in the donation process by keeping your supporters on your page, reducing the time and the number of steps needed to give to your cause.

Build Classy’s latest embedded campaigns with Embedded Studio. It’s a new and improved iteration of embedded donation forms that provide greater accessibility, improved performance, and more options to set up your website exactly how you need it.

## Create

To create an embedded form:

1. In Classy, go to **Campaigns**
2. Select **Create new campaign**
3. Next to Embedded form, select **Create**

Then, add your campaign details, such as name, color, and goal.

### Safelist domains

Safelist the domains where your form will appear to ensure it only shows on approved sites. Add URLs for every site hosting the form, including any test sites.

## Design

Use the Embedded Studio designer to style each page of your form and adjust options like donation amounts and frequencies.

**To edit pages:**

1. Go to the **Design** tab
2. Select the page you want to edit from the dropdown menu

## Save, publish, and update your form

The **Save**, **Publish**, and **Update** options are in the header for easy access.

- **Publish** your campaign to make it visible on your website.
- Use **Update** after making edits to push changes live.

!!! note

    Once the campaign is live, updates to your form do not require changes to the Install snippet or embed code.

## Install and embed

To embed your campaign:

1. **Safelist your domains.**
2. **Add the Install snippet** to the `<head>` section of your website.
3. **Place the form** on your chosen web pages.

!!! warning "Important"

    Add only one Install snippet per website to avoid performance issues. A single snippet will support all embedded campaigns on your site.

To find the Install snippet and embed code:

1. Open the campaign’s **Settings** tab
2. Select **Install**

To add the code to your site, we offer builder-specific guides for:
