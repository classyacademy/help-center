    Embedded donation forms are only available for [Classy Pay](http://support.classy.org/s/article/how-to-set-up-classy-pay-powered-by-stripe) customers.

Build Classy’s latest embedded campaigns with Embedded Studio. It’s a new and improved iteration of embedded donation forms that provide greater accessibility, improved performance, and more options to set up your website exactly how you need it.

2. Select **Create new campaign**
3. Next to Embedded form, select **Create**

Then, add your campaign details, such as name, color, and goal.

### Safelist domains

Safelist the domains where your form will appear to ensure it only shows on approved sites. Add URLs for every site hosting the form, including any test sites.

## Design

Use the Embedded Studio designer to style each page of your form and adjust options like donation amounts and frequencies.

**To edit pages:**

1. Go to the **Design** tab.
2. Select the page you want to edit from the dropdown menu.

Pages available for customization include:

## Save, publish, and update your form

The **Save**, **Publish**, and **Update** options are in the header for easy access.

- **Publish** your campaign to make it visible on your website.
- Use **Update** after making edits to push changes live.

!!! note

    Once the campaign is live, updates to your form do not require changes to the Install snippet or embed code.

## Install and embed

To embed your campaign:

1. **Safelist your domains.**
2. **Add the Install snippet** to the `<head>` section of your website.
3. **Place the form** on your chosen web pages.

!!! warning "Important"

    Add only one Install snippet per website to avoid performance issues. A single snippet will support all embedded campaigns on your site.

To find the Install snippet and embed code:

1. Open the campaign’s **Settings** tab
2. Select **Installation**

To add the code to your site, we offer builder-specific guides for:
