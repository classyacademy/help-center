# Embedded Studio Designer

The Embedded Studio designer is divided into two sections:

- **Options panel**: Adjust Style and Configure settings for each page.
- **Preview panel**: Displays real-time updates to show how changes will look for supporters.

**Switching between pages**

Each page has unique style and configuration options. We recommend reviewing each page to make sure it aligns with your campaign goals.

To change pages:

1. Go to the **Design** tab
2. Choose a page from the dropdown menu

## Inline donation grid

The inline donation grid appears directly on your website’s page, allowing supporters to select a donation amount and open the embedded form to complete their transaction.

**Styling options** for the inline donation grid:

- Border radius
- Button colors
- Background colors and opacity
- Drop shadow

**Configuration options** (found in the Configure tab):

- Donation frequencies and suggested amounts

## Embedded form

The embedded form overlays your website when a supporter clicks the donate button or selects an amount on the inline donation grid.

**Styling options**:

- Border radius

### Content panel

Add a content panel to the form to showcase a donation’s impact and encourage giving.

To toggle on the panel:

1. Go to the **Configure** tab
2. Toggle the content panel on or off, then select it in the **Preview panel** to access its options

Next to Image, switch between **Content** and **Hero images** to adjust the panel's overall look.

#### Content

Add images, text, and sponsor logos to the panel to showcase how donations make an impact and encourage giving.

#### Hero image

Display a larger image spanning the entire panel with a heading on top.

### Recurring donation nudge

Recurring nudges help turn one-time gifts into sustainable monthly donors. When someone chooses a one-time gift between your highest and lowest options, this nudge suggests a smaller monthly donation that’s 25% of the selected amount.

**To turn on the recurring donation nudge**:

1. Go to the **Settings** tab
2. Toggle it on under **Donation options**

The recurring nudge includes a graphic whose style, icon, and animation options you can edit.

### Donor covered fees nudge

The donor covered fees nudge prompts donors to cover transaction fees, ensuring that the full donation amount goes to the organization.

**To turn on the donor covered fees nudge**:

1. Go to the **Settings** tab
2. Toggle it on under **Donation options**

The donor covered fees nudge also includes a graphic with style, icon, and animation options you can edit.

### Thank you screen

The thank you screen appears after a transaction is complete. This page lets you show appreciation and encourages supporters to share the campaign with their network, increasing your campaign’s reach.
