However, Classy will support two factors: a password and a one-time passcode.</p> <p>How is MFA different from SSO?</p> <p>SSO lets users access multiple applications with a single login.

To unlock it, contact our Care team, who can unlock or reset authenticators via the Okta console.</p> <p>Can my organization configure which admins get prompted for MFA?</p> <p>No. Our out-of-the-box Okta solution applies MFA to all admins without customization options.</p> <p>Will MFA apply to Classy Live log-ins?</p> <p>Not at this time, but we may consider MFA for Classy Live in future updates.</p> <p>Will email be considered as an authentication factor?</p> <p>No. Due to phishing risks, email won\u2019t be used as an authentication factor.
